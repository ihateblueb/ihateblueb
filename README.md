<h3> Hi there, I'm blueb! </h3>
<p> I'm a student learning how to create websites, apps, and Minecraft plugins. I've worked in Java, Vue, HTML, JS, and dabbled in Python. </p>
<p> Me and two of my friends run a Minecraft server and create things for it under Orchid Development. <a href="https://github.com/orchidtowny">Check us out!</a> </p>
<p> I'm currently working on Starling, more on that soon. </p>
